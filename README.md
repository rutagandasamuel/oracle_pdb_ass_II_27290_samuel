## 5. Task 3 – Oracle Enterprise Manager
Oracle Enterprise Manager was configured and accessed successfully.
The dashboard shows the Oracle environment and created PDB.

## 6. Challenges Faced
- The first challenge i have faced was creating the temporary PDB, i thought i would just continue from where i had just made the user not knowing you have to
change back from inside the container to root inorder to create that PDB.
- Currently the OEM is not working for me.

## 7. Integrity Statement
I confirm that this assignment is my own work and was completed individually.
